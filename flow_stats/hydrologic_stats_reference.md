# Hydrologic Statistics Reference

This reference describes the hydrologic indices currently implemented in the Python version of **eflowstats**.

---

## üìò General

- **Water year handling**  
  Water years are calculated relative to the `start_month` parameter (default: October = 10).  
  Incomplete water years (missing dates or NaN flows) are excluded.

- **Exclusion ranges**  
  Users may specify custom date ranges to omit from calculations.

## üåü Magnificent 7 Indicators (Mag7)
The **Magnificent 7 (Mag7)** metrics are computed by `all_stats()` and represent key annual hydrologic characteristics.  

| Metric | Column Name | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| Mean flow (Œª‚ÇÅ) | `lam1` | Average daily flow for the water year. |
| L-CV (œÑ‚ÇÇ) | `tau2` | L-moment coefficient of variation. |
| L-skew (œÑ‚ÇÉ) | `tau3` | L-moment skewness. |
| L-kurtosis (œÑ‚ÇÑ) | `tau4` | L-moment kurtosis. |
| AR(1) coefficient | `ar1` | Lag-1 autocorrelation of daily flows. |
| Amplitude | `amplitude` | Magnitude of seasonal variation. |
| Phase | `phase` | Timing of peak seasonal flow (radians/degrees). |

## üîπ HIAP (Henriksen et al., 2006) Statistics
The **HIAP_stats** function computes a suite of hydrologic indices based on Henriksen et al. 2006 methodology. The naming conventions align with `py_flowstats` for consistency.  

| HIAP Stat | Existing in py_flowstats? | Column Name | Notes |
|------------|--------------------------|-------------|-------|
| Ma1 | Yes | `mag_mean` | Mean of daily flows over the entire record. |
| Ma3 | Partially | `cv_annual` | Mean (or median) of per-year CVs of daily flows. |
| Ml17 | Partially | `min_7day_ratio` | Ratio of 7-day minimum to mean annual flow per year; aggregate mean/median. |
| Fl1 | Yes | `low_pulse_count` | Low pulse frequency (‚â§ 25th percentile). |
| Fh1 | Yes | `high_pulse_count` | High pulse frequency (‚â• 75th percentile). |
| Fh5 | Yes | `fh5` | Flood frequency above median flow. |
| Ta2 | Yes | `colwell_predictability` | Predictability metric from Colwell analysis. |
| Ta3 | Yes | `ta3` | Seasonal predictability of flooding (max flood days / total flood days). |
| Tl2 | Yes | `cv_julian_min` | Variability in timing of annual minima. |
| Th1 | Yes | `julian_max` | Timing of annual maximum flow. |
| Phase | Yes | `phase` | Flow-weighted timing of hydrograph. |
| Dh2 | Yes | `max_3day_mean` | Annual maximum 3-day moving average; aggregate mean/median. |

**Notes:**

- For `Ma3`, `Ml17`, and `Dh2`, HIAP_stats computes per-year statistics and then aggregates using **mean or median** based on user preference.  
- Column names were chosen to match `py_flowstats` naming conventions where possible (`mag_mean`, `cv_annual`, `julian_max`, etc.).  
- HIAP_stats returns a `pandas.DataFrame` formatted identically to `all_stats()`, with per-water-year rows and an aggregated `all_years` row.

---

## üì¶ Output

- All statistics (Mag7 and HIAP) are computed **per water year** and summarized into an `all_years` row.  
- Output is returned as a `pandas.DataFrame` ready for further analysis or CSV export.
