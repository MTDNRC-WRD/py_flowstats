âš¡ Notes:  
- `all_years` rows represent aggregate stats across the full dataset.  
- Percentile cutoffs differ slightly between **Magnificent 7** (90/10) vs **pulse stats** (75/25), following IHA convention.  
- Day of year (`doy_*`) values are based on water year indexing but reported as Julian day (Jan 1 = 1).
